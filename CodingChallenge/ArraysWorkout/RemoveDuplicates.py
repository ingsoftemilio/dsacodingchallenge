Exercise: Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array
Given a sorted array of integers, remove the duplicates in place so that each unique element appears only once. Return the length of the modified array after duplicates are removed. Do not use any extra space for another array; modify the input array directly.

You only need to keep the unique elements at the beginning of the array. Itâ€™s okay if the extra elements after the unique ones are not removed, as long as the length returned is correct.

Example
Input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
Output: 4, with the modified array as [0, 1, 2, 3, _, _, _] (where _ represents any value, as these indices are irrelevant)
