Challenge: Find the First Non-Repeating Character
Given a string, find the first character that does not repeat and return its index. If all characters repeat, return -1. This is a common interview problem and a good way to practice counting and lookups with dictionaries.

Example
Input: "swiss"
Output: 0 (The first non-repeating character is 's' at index 0)

Input: "aabbcc"
Output: -1 (All characters repeat)
